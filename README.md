# odin-recipes

Introduction to Recipes Website Project: In this project I will be creating an index 
page that will house multiple links to various recipes that I consider to be the highest tier
of food ever made. I will be leveraging git skills, basic HTML organization skills,
and the terminal to navigate and create directories.
